# Delhivery Logistics Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis of Delhivery's logistics data. The project aims to uncover trends and actionable insights by processing and analyzing data from Delhivery's logistics operations. The goal is to improve operational efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall performance by generating valuable insights for the data science team.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning competitions and datasets. It includes detailed records of delivery operations, such as trip details, route types, and regional logistics activity. This dataset provides a rich foundation for understanding delivery processes and identifying opportunities for improvement.

## Repository Contents

- `Delhivery_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the complete data analysis workflow. This includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and the dataset used in the analysis.
- `README.md`: This document, providing an overview of the repository, instructions for usage, and additional information.

## Analysis Summary

The analytical approach in this project is organized into distinct sections, each targeting specific aspects of the data:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, sanitizing, and manipulating raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
- **Aggregation and Analysis**: Combining delivery details into comprehensive records to understand trip-level metrics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data, such as extracting components from names and calculating trip durations.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identifying and handling outliers to ensure data quality and reliability.
- **Model Preparation**: Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features to prepare the data for predictive modeling.
- **Hypothesis Testing and Visual Analysis**: Comparing various metrics to gain insights into the efficiency and accuracy of delivery operations.

Key statistical methods and visualization techniques are used throughout the analysis to effectively communicate insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights

- **Route Utilization Differences**: Carting is used more frequently than Full Truck Load (FTL), indicating a preference for smaller, more frequent deliveries.
- **Regional Logistics Activity**: High logistics activity is observed in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Haryana, while regions like Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh show minimal operations.
- **Discrepancies Between Estimated and Actual Metrics**: Systematic deviations were noted where actual logistics times are higher than estimated, and traveled distances are less than predicted.

## Recommendations

- **Optimization of Route Types**: Enhance carting operations and explore opportunities for improving Full Truck Load (FTL) efficiency.
- **Focus on High-Activity Regions**: Upgrade facilities and manage fleets in regions with high logistics activity.
- **Addressing Low-Activity Regions**: Analyze and address barriers in regions with minimal logistics operations.
- **Adjusting to Discrepancies**: Refine OSRM estimates and incorporate more localized data to improve accuracy.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into Delhivery's logistics operations, highlighting areas for improvement and opportunities for optimization. By addressing these insights, Delhivery can enhance efficiency, better adapt to regional demands, and respond to evolving market conditions.
